    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a 31 year of male who is looking for a career in I.T, paritcularly Web Development. I currently work for Merton Council as an Housing Options Advisor.
        My educational background requires me to have a strong analytical mind as it involved a lot of analyzing and a lot of quantitative data used through statistical 
        packages such as SPSS. Thus, I am able to investigate and spot any changes in patterns of trends as a result. I am able to write accurate and timely reports as this
         was the mode of my assessment during my undergrad and postgrad programs. I was required to write numerous essays and reports which ranged from 1,500 words to 15,000 words 
         and complete them in a specified timeline. This has allowed me to naturally organize my workload whenever I am set a task as it is always my goal to complete my workload in time. 
         Through various practical assignments such as crime analysis, I now have an investigative mind that allows me to spot any mistakes of discrepancies and enquire about them. Completing my master’s 
         program has not only given me the status of a qualified researcher but it has also given me the skills to; identify an original topic for investigation and plan and carry out a lengthy piece of research
          and/or theoretical enquiry, synthesise and apply a wide variety of up-to-date sources and information according to the goals of their study and develop a well argued, innovative and evidence-based piece of 
          writing.I like to keep myself up to date with world current affairs. I am a subscriber of The Times newspaper and Bloomberg Business week which betters myself everyday as it keeps me informed about world events 
          and the economy around the world. I also carry out my own independent research and write my own articles concerning social issues and world events in my spare time.My as a Criminal Justice Case Manager role requires 
          me to work with challenging individuals who are involved in the criminal justice system and who has been screened in the personality disorder pathway. As a case manager for Shaw Trust, I am based in the probation 
          service where I support the probation officers in getting their hardest to reach service users back into employment. The hardest to reach meaning those with significant barriers that will lead them to re-offend. 
          This ranges from accommodation issues to substance misuse.I now currently work as a Court Probation Service Officer. This role requires me to assist the Court with sentencing by carrying out oral or written reports, 
          highlighting the trigger in offending and the circumstances surrounding the defendant that may have led to a life of crime or recent offending. Using the searching guidelines, I would then assist the Court in terms of 
          appropriate sentence to propose.
